19 EXT. PRIVET DRIVE - NIGHT 
• C 
Dark at this hour, except for·the STREET LAMPS that dot the 
street, spilling deep pools of light upon the ground. 
On the far corner, a MAN MATERIALIZES out of the darkness. 
Be is tall and thin, with a silver beard long enough to 
tuck into his belt. Be wears a PURPLE CLOAK and is roughly 
one hundred and fifty years old. Be is ALBUS DOMBLEDORE. 
t>umbledore removes a small silver object from his cloak-­
the PUT-OUTER. Be extends his hand and--CLICK--the nearest 
street lamp GOES OUT with a soft pop. Be continues to click 
the Put-outer until all the lamps go DARK. 
Be turns, spies a CAT, sitting on the wall of Number Four. 
Be smiles knowingly. 
DUMBLEDORE 
I should have known you'd be here, 
Professor McGonagall. 
The cat leaps forward, TRANSFIGURES itself into a rather 
severe-looking woman in an EMERALD CLOAK. 
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL 
Are the rumors true, Albus? 
DUMBLEDORE 
(smile fading) 
I'm afraid so. The good. And the bad. 
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL 
And the boy? 
DUMBLEDORE 
Bagrid's bringing him; 
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL 
You think i~ ••• wise ••• to trust Bagrid 
with something as important as this? 
DUMBLEDORE 
I would trust Bagrid with my life, 
Professor. 
A LOW RUMBLE disturbs the skies. Dumbledore and McGonagall 
look up and--suddenly--a HUGE MOTORCYCLE plummets through 
the clouds, hits. ·the ground with a THUNDEROUS ROAR. As the 
SMOKE clears, a FIGURE climbs off. Be is BAGRID and is, 
quite obviously, a GIANT. In his vast, muscular arms, he 
holds a BUNDLE of BLANRETS. 1-18

Exactly. It would be enough to turn 
any boy's head. Famous before he can 
walk and talk. Famous for something he 
won't even remember. No. He'll be much 
better off growing up away from all 
that. Until he's ready. 
Dumbledore lays the.bundle on the mat. Hagrid SNIFFLES. 
DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) 
There, there, Bagrid. It's not really 
goodbye, after all. 
Bagrid nods. Dumbledore tucks a PARCHMENT ENVELOPE into the 
blankets and steps back, his face suddenly dark. Serious.

As Harry breaks the foil on his pack, the frog springs into

·Thank.you for that assessment, Mr.

Then perhaps a map. I trust you don't

Harry and Ron Slink past Hermione, sitting front row center. 
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL (CONT'D) 
Transfiguration is some of the most 
complex, dangerous and valuable magic you 
will learn at Hogwarts. Use it skillfully 
and it may, one day, save your life. Make 
a mistake and you could find yourself 
with a toad's head and a monkey's tail.

EXT. THE GROUNDS - HOGWARTS - DAY 
Harry stands in a cluster of Gryffindors, across from Malfoy 
and.his Slytherin cronies. Between them, there is a LONG LINE 
OF BROOMSTICKS. MADAME HOOCH, a rangy witch.with short grey 
hair and hawk-like eyes, stands between the two groups. 
MADAME HOOCH 
Welcome to your first Flying Lesson. 
Well, what are you all waiting for? 
Everyone step up to a broomstick. Come 
now. Hurry up. · 
Harry steps forward nervously, glances down. His broom is 
old, with twigs sticking out at odd angles. 
MADAME HOOCH (CONT'D) 
Stick out your right hand, over the 
broom, and say "Up"! 
SHOUTS of "Up!" ring on the cold afternoon air. Though he 
barely WHISPERS the command, Harry's broom SNAPS smartly into 
his hand. Hermione's simply rolls over. Ron's FLIES UP and 
CRACKS HIM IN THE NOSE. 
MADAME HOOCH (CONT'D) 
Now. Once you've got hold of the broom, I 
want you to mount it. And grip it tight. 
We don't want you sliding off the end.

Clutching desperately to his broom, Neville caroms crazily 
off a tree, flops upside down, rockets past the other

As they go, Harry watches Neville's broom sail high over 
Hagrid's house, where the giant himself sits in the front 
garden, watching with a pair of BINOCULARS. Malfoy scoops 
Neville's Remernbrall from the grass, cackles.

Harry glowers up at Malfoy, then GRABS his broom.

said. Besides you don't even know how 
to ... fly. 
Harry shoots into·the sky, so angry that it's a moment before 
he realizes what the others see ~learly: he's a natural. 
Turning h~s broomstick sharply, he hovers, glaring at Malfoy. 
HARRY 
Give it here. Or I'll knock you off that 
ruddy broom.

Harry SHOOTS forth like a javelin, Malfoy just managing to 
slip his charge. As Harry whips around, Malfoy glances down

Slytherin Chaser, DUCKS UNDER a sizzling Blµdger that Fred 
Weasley C~IPS AWAY, then DISHES OFF to a speeding Alicia .

a Bludger himself, courtesy of George Weasley. Angelina 
Johnson swoops down, snatches the spinning Quaffle and, 
flying like li_ghtning, races the field to score~ 
As Gryffindor CHEERS fill the cold air, Hagrid makes his way 
up the stands, scattering students in his wake.

Ron and Hermione squeeze together, giving Hagrid space.

Above the pitch, Slytherin's ADRIAN POCEY eludes two 
Bludgers, two Weasleys and the Chaser, ZOOMING toward the 
goals •.. when suddenly a FLASH OF GOLD zips by his left ear. 
HARRY

·Far below, Slytherin Seeker TERENCE HIGGS makes his move.

RON/HERMIONE/HAGRID 
-FOUL! FOUL! FOUL! 
As a Bludger screams past Harry, he tries to kick his broom · 
higher. Instead, it LURCHES, nearly tossing him off. Below, 
Hagrid peers through his BINOCULARS, frowns. 
HAGRID 
Dunno what Harry thinks he's doin'. If I 
didn't know better, I'd say he's lost 
control of his broom ••• 
RON 
Maybe something happened to it when Flint 
blocked him. 
In the stands, people gasp as the broom-ROLLS OVER and leaves 
Harry DANGLING from one end. Neville buries his face. 
HAGRID 
No. Can't nothin' interfere with a 
broomstick except. powerful Dark magic. No 
kid could do that to a Nimbus 2000. 
Hearing this, Hermione GRABS Hagrid'_ s binoculars. 
HERMIONE

It's Snape. He's jinxing the broom .. 
Ron takes the binoculars, looks. Snape sits MUTTERING in the 
opposite stands, staring into the sky. Staring at Harry. 
RON 
Jinxing the broom? What do we do? 
HERMIONE 
Leave it to me. 
As Hermione dashes off, Ron turns the binoculars back to the 
sky. Harry hangs from the broom with two hands while Fred 
hovers nearby. George circles about ten feet below.

·-Take a good look,· lads. With any luck 
we'll.be having Potter soup for supper--
Just then:-: Hermione brushes past, sending Malfoy ass .over tea 
kettle into Professor Quirrell in the row below. Reaching 
Snape, Hermione crouches down and whips out her wand. 
Across the field Ron peers through the binoculars ••. 
RON 
Corne on, Hermione .•• 
Just then, BLUE FLAMES spit from Hermione's wand, climbing 
quickly up Snape's robes. Snape continues to mutter, staring 
skyward, then realizes he's on fire, and looks away. In the 
commotion, that ensues, Ron sees Hermione scoop the blue fire 
into a little jar, slip it. into robe, and.make her escape. 
Instantly, Harry' s broom stops j.erking. He clambers back on, 
when--SWOOSH!--A FLASH OF GOLD streaks by him: the Snitch. 
Higgs ZOOMS _UP from below and he and Harry give chase. 
The Snitch SWERVES, then ••. DIVES. As it PLUMMETS, Harry and 
Higgs plummet too, giving it all they've got. 
On the pitch below, Hermione puts her hand to her mouth. In 
the stands, Neville buries his head again. 
As the Snitch drops, the ground rushes c:::razily upward, the 
speed breathtaking. Harry seems intoxicated by it, slightly 
crazed, eyes riveted to the fluttering Snitch, seeing it and 
only it. Higgs, on the other hand, sees only the ground and, 
at the last minute, can bear it no longer, PULLING UP on his 
broom-and SWERVING to safety. As Harry and earth collide, the 
Nimbus cartwheels away, Harry rolls off and, corning up on all 
fours, claps his hand to his mouth. As if he were sick.·
